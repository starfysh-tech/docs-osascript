# Find text in a script using Script Editor on Mac

You can use the Find command to find and replace a word, statement, or any set of characters in an AppleScript script, regardless of how many times it occurs in the script.

You can search for text in the whole script or in a selected area.

   * Click Replace to replace the found text, then enter the replacement text.
   * To filter your searches, click the Search pop-up menu ![](https://help.apple.com/assets/67DB7E842551EA97CB00BED5/67DB7E8502C5F38AAF0D7DC6/en_US/bb4de0babc81c7fedb3e9663d00d7a3a.png), then choose an option:

     * *Ignore Case:* Find text independent of whether letters are capitalized or lowercase.
     * *Wrap Around:* When you reach the end of the document, continue searching from the top.
     * *Contains:* Find text contained inside words. For example, if you type “most,” Script Editor also finds “almost.”
     * *Starts With:* Find letters at the beginning of words.
     * *Full Word:* Search only for the complete word you typed in the Find field.
     * *Insert Pattern:* Add special characters, wildcards, or patterns into your search.
