Glossary

absolute object specifier

An object specifier that has enough information to identify an object or objects uniquely. For an object specifier to an application object to be complete, its outermost container must be the application itself. See
relative object specifier
.

Apple event

An interprocess message that encapsulates a command in a form that can be passed across process boundaries, performed, and responded to with a reply event. When an AppleScript script is executed, a statement that targets a scriptable application may result in an Apple event being sent to that application.

AppleScript

A scripting language that makes possible direct control of scriptable applications and scriptable parts of macOS.

AppleScript command

A script command provided by AppleScript. AppleScript commands do not have to be included in
tell
 statements.

application command

A command that is defined by scriptable application to provide access to a scriptable feature. An application command must either be included in a
tell
 statement or include the name of the application in its direct parameter.

application object

An object stored in an application or its documents and managed by the application.

arbitrary reference form

A reference form that specifies an arbitrary object in a container.

assignment statement

A statement that assigns a value to a variable. Assignment statements use the
copy
 or
set
 commands.

attribute

A characteristic that can be considered or ignored in a
considering
 or
ignoring
 statement.

binary operator

An operator that derives a new value from a pair of values.

boolean

A logical truth value; see the
boolean
 class.

Boolean expression

An expression whose value can be either true or false.

chevrons

See
double angle brackets
.

child script object

A
script
 object that inherits properties and handlers from another object, called the parent.

class

(1) A category for objects that share characteristics such as properties and elements and respond to the same commands. (2) The label for the AppleScript
class
 property—a reserved word that specifies the class to which an object belongs.

coercion

The process of converting an object from one class to another. For example, an integer value can be coerced into a real value. Also, the software that performs such a conversion. Also known as object conversion.

command

A word or series of words that requests an action. See also
handler
.

comment

Text that remains in a script after compilation but is ignored by AppleScript when the script is executed.

compile

In AppleScript, to convert a script from the form typed into a script editor to a form that can be used by AppleScript. The process of compiling a script includes syntax and vocabulary checks. A script is compiled when you first run it and again when you modify it and then run it again, save it, or check its syntax.

compiled script

The form to which a script is converted when you compile it.

composite value

A value that contains other values. Lists, records, and strings are examples of composite values.

compound statement

A statement that occupies more than one line and contains other statements. A compound statement begins with a reserved word indicating its function and ends with the word
end
. See also
simple statement
.

conditional statement

See
if statement
.

considering statement

A control statement that lists a specific set of attributes to be considered when AppleScript performs operations on strings or sends commands to applications.

constant

A reserved word with a predefined value; see the
constant
 class.

.

continuation character

A character used in Script Editor to extend a statement to the next line. With a U.S. keyboard, you can enter this character by typing Option-l (lower-case L).

continue statement

A statement that controls when and how other statements are executed. AppleScript defines standard control statements such as
if
,
repeat
, and
while
.

control statement

A statement that causes AppleScript to exit the current handler and transfer execution to the handler with the same name in the parent. A
continue
 statement can also be used to invoke an inherited handler in the local context.

current application

The application that is using the AppleScript component to compile and execute scripts (typically, Script Editor).

current script

The script currently being executed.

current target

The object that is the current default target for commands.

data

A class used for data that do not belong to any of the other AppleScript classes; see the
data
 class.

date

A class that specifies a time, day of the month, month, and year; see the
date
 class.

declaration

The first occurrence of a variable or property identifier in a script. The form and location of the declaration determine how AppleScript treats the identifier in that script—for example, as a property, global variable, or local variable.

default target

The object that receives a command if no object is specified or if the object is incompletely specified in the command. Default (or implicit) targets are specified in
tell
 statements.

delegation

The handing off of control to another object. In AppleScript, the use of a

list
 or an
application
 object, but it is typically another

real
 class.

record

An unordered collection of properties, identified by unique labels; see the
record

recursive handler

A handler that calls itself.

reference

An object that encapsulates an object specifier.
