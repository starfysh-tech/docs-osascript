They are rare, and often there is nothing you can do about them in a script, other than report them. A few, such as `\"User canceled\"`, make sense for scripts to handle—as shown, for an example, in the Examples section for the [display dialog](ASLR_cmds.md#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH216-SW12) command.\n\n<a id=\"//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH220-SW4\"></a>\n\n**Table B-2**  Mac OS errors\n\n| Error number | Error message |\n| 0 | No error. |\n| -34 | Disk &lt;name&gt; full. |\n| -35 | Disk &lt;name&gt; wasn’t found. |\n| -37 | Bad name for file |\n| -38 | File &lt;name&gt; wasn’t open. |\n| -39 | End of file error. |\n| -42 | Too many files open. |\n| -43 | File &lt;name&gt; wasn’t found. |\n| -44 | Disk &lt;name&gt; is write protected. |\n| -45 | File &lt;name&gt; is locked. |\n| -46 | Disk &lt;name&gt; is locked. |\n| -47 | File &lt;name&gt; is busy. |\n| -48 | Duplicate file name. |\n| -49 | File &lt;name&gt; is already open. |\n| -50 | Parameter error. |\n| -51 | File reference number error. |\n| -61 | File not open with write permission. |\n| -108 | Out of memory. |\n| -120 | Folder &lt;name&gt; wasn’t found. |\n| -124 | Disk &lt;name&gt; is disconnected. |\n| -128 | User cancelled. |\n| -192 | A resource wasn’t found. |\n| -600 | Application isn’t running |\n| -601 | Not enough room to launch application with special requirements. |\n| -602 | Application is not 32-bit clean. |\n| -605 | More memory needed than is specified in the size resource. |\n| -606 | Application is background-only. |\n| -607 | Buffer is too small. |\n| -608 | No outstanding high-level event. |\n| -609 | Connection is invalid. |\n| -904 | Not enough system memory to connect to remote application. |\n| -905 | Remote access is not allowed. |\n| -906 | &lt;name&gt; isn’t running or program linking isn’t enabled. |\n| -915 | Can’t find remote machine. |\n| -30720 | Invalid date and time &lt;date string&gt;. |\n\n<a id=\"//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH220-SW6\"></a>\n\n## Apple Event Errors\n\n<a id=\"//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH220-DontLinkElementID_911\"></a><a id=\"//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH220-DontLinkElementID_912\"></a>An Apple event error may occur when an app attempts to process an event sent by a script or a script attempts to process the reply.\n\n<a id=\"//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH220-SW7\"></a>\n\n**Table B-3**  Apple Event Manager errors\n\n| Error number | Error message |\n| -1700 | Bad parameter data was detected or there was a failure while performing a coercion. |\n| -1701 | An Apple event description was not found. |\n| -1702 | Corrupt data was detected. |\n| -1703 | The wrong data type was detected. |\n| -1704 | An invalid Apple event description was detected. |\n| -1705 | The specified list item doesn’t exist. |\n| -1706 | A newer version of Apple Event Manager is required to perform this operation. |\n| -1707 | The event isn’t an Apple event. |\n| -1708 | The script doesn’t understand the &lt;message&gt; message. The event was not handled. |\n| -1709 | An invalid reply parameter was received by `AEResetTimer`. |\n| -1710 | An invalid sending mode (something other than `NoReply`, `WaitReply`, or `QueueReply`) was detected or interaction level is unknown. |\n| -1711 | The user canceled while waiting for an event reply. |\n| -1712 | The Apple event has timed out. |\n| -1713 | User interaction is not allowed. |\n| -1714 | There is no special function for this keyword. |\n| -1715 | A required parameter is missing. |\n| -1716 | The target address type of an Apple event is unknown. |\n| -1717 | Unable to find a matching event or coercion handler. |\n| -1718 | Unable to access the contents of an event reply because the reply hasn’t been received yet. |\n| -1719 | The specified index is invalid or out of range. |\n| -1720 | The specified range is invalid, such as `3rd` to `2nd` or `1st` to `all`. |\n| -1721 | The wrong number of arguments was detected. |\n| -1723 | The accessor was not found. |\n| -1725 | There is no such Boolean operator. |\n| -1726 | An invalid comparison was made or an invalid logical descriptor was detected. |\n| -1727 | `AEResolve` was given a non-object parameter. |\n| -1728 | The referenced object doesn’t exist. This is a run-time resolution error, such as when attempting to reference a third object when only two objects exist. |\n| -1729 | An object counting procedure returned a negative value. |\n| -1730 | Attempted to pass an empty list to an accessor. |\n| -1731 | An unknown type of object was detected. |\n| -10000 | The Apple event handler failed. |\n| -10001 | A type mismatch has occurred. |\n| -10002 | Invalid key form was detected. |\n| -10003 | The specified object cannot be modified. |\n| -10004 | A privilege error has occurred. |\n| -10005 | The read operation was denied. |\n| -10006 | The write operation was denied. |\n| -10007 | The object index is too large. |\n| -10008 | The specified object is not an element. |\n| -10009 | Unable to provide the requested type. |\n| -10010 | The Apple event handler doesn’t support the specified class. |\n| -10011 | The event is not part of the current transaction. |\n| -10012 | There is no such transaction. |\n| -10013 | Nothing is selected by the user. |\n| -10014 | The Apple event handler only handles single objects. |\n| -10015 | The previous action can’t be undone. |\n| -10016 | The Apple event handler does not handle remote events. |\n| -10023 | The specified constant value is invalid for this property. |\n| -10024 | The specified class can’t be an element of the specified container, such as when attempting to make or duplicate an object. |\n| -10025 | An invalid combination of properties was provided, such as for the `set`, `make`, or `duplicate` command. |\n\n<a id=\"//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH220-SW8\"></a>\n\n## Open Scripting Architecture Errors\n\n<a id=\"//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH220-DontLinkElementID_913\"></a><a id=\"//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH220-DontLinkElementID_914\"></a>An Open Scripting Architecture error may occur when the scripting system itself encounters an error.\n\n<a id=\"//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH220-SW9\"></a>\n\n**Table B-4**  Open Scripting Architecture errors\n\n| Error number | Error message |\n| -1750 | A scripting component error has occurred. |\n| -1751 | An invalid script ID was detected. |\n| -1752 | The script isn’t a supported type. |\n| -1753 | A script error has occurred. |\n| -1754 | A bad selector was detected. |\n| -1756 | The source is not available. |\n| -1757 | There is no matching dialect. |\n| -1758 | The data format is obsolete. |\n| -1759 | The data format is too new. |\n| -1761 | There is a component mismatch—parameters are from two different components. |\n| -1762 | Unable to connect to the scripting system matching the specified ID. |\n| -1763 | Unable to store memory pointers in a saved script. |\n\n  \n\n---\n\nCopyright © 2016 Apple Inc.
