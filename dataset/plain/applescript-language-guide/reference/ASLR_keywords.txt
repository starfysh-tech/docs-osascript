AppleScript Keywords

This appendix lists AppleScript keywords (or
reserved words
), provides a brief description for each, and points to related information, where available. (See also
Keywords
 in
AppleScript Lexical Conventions
.)

The keywords in
Table A-1
 are part of the AppleScript language. You should not attempt to reuse them in your scripts for variable names or other purposes. Developers should not re-define keywords in the terminology for their scriptable applications. You can view many additional scripting terms defined by Apple, but not part of the AppleScript language, in
AppleScript Terminology and Apple Event Codes
.
