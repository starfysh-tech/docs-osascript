AppleScript Overview
 provides a high-level overview of AppleScript and its related technologies to help you determine where you can use them in your work.

Note:
 For information on the universe of scripting technologies available on OS X, see
Getting Started With Scripting & Automation
.

AppleScript is a scripting language that makes possible direct control of scriptable applications and of many parts of the Mac OS. A scriptable application is one that makes its operations and data available in response to AppleScript messages, called Apple events.

With scriptable applications, users can write scripts to automate operations, while developers can use AppleScript as an aid to rapid prototyping and automated testing. Developers can also use technologies including Apple events, AppleScript, Automator, and Scripting Bridge, to take advantage of services provided by other applications and by the Mac OS.

AppleScript and Apple events are based on the Open Scripting Architecture, which is implemented by several OS X frameworks. Apple provides a number of additional applications and technologies that enhance AppleScript or take advantage of its features.
