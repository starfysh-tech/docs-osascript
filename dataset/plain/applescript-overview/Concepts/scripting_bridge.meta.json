This allows Cocoa applications and other Objective-C code to efficiently access features of scriptable applications, using native Objective-C syntax. Some other scripting languages, such as Ruby and Python, can use also Scripting Bridge (they also have open-source software bridges to scriptable applications—RubyOSA and py-appscript). For more information, see *[Ruby and Python Programming Topics for Mac](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/../../Cocoa/Conceptual/RubyPythonCocoa/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004936)*.\n\nTo use Scripting Bridge, you add the Scripting Bridge framework to your application project and use command-line tools to generate the interface files for the scriptable application you want to target. Then in your application code, you obtain a reference to an application object for the targeted scriptable application and send Objective-C messages to it.\n\nFor details, see *[Scripting Bridge Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/../../Cocoa/Conceptual/ScriptingBridgeConcepts/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006104)* and *[Scripting Bridge Framework Reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scriptingbridge)*.
