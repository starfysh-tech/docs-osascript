Add commands using the shortcut menu in Script Editor on Mac

Script Editor lets you insert prewritten routines into your script using the shortcut menu (also known as a
contextual menu
). This can reduce the amount of time you spend typing and fixing errors when writing a script.

Open Script Editor for me

In the Script Editor app
 on your Mac,
Control-click
 the script window, then choose a routine from the pop-up menu.

The routine is inserted at the cursor location in the script. If text is selected in the script, the routine is wrapped around the selected text.

Here are some of the routines you can insert into your script.

Routine

Description

Error handlers

Error routines provide information related to any errors encountered when you run the script.

Image manipulation

Image manipulation routines do graphics processing of image files.

Tell blocks

“Tell” blocks direct a series of commands to a particular app or component.

Conditionals

Conditional statements run a series of commands if the correct conditions exist.

Iterate items

Iteration routines process multiple files.

Repeat routines

Repeat routines cause a series of commands to repeat until a condition changes.

String comparison

Lets you consider or ignore specific types of characters when comparing strings.

Action clauses

Action clauses apply special conditions to the execution of a group of statements.

Folder action handlers

Folder actions occur when a change happens to a folder. Use the folder action to automatically run a script.

Dialogs

Dialog routines let you ask the user questions when you run the script.
