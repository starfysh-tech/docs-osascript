  "body": "# Add commands using the shortcut menu in Script Editor on Mac\n\nScript Editor lets you insert prewritten routines into your script using the shortcut menu (also known as a *contextual menu*). This can reduce the amount of time you spend typing and fixing errors when writing a script.\n\n[Open Script Editor for me](https://support.apple.com/guide/script-editor/add-commands-using-the-shortcut-menu-apscrpt1084/2.11/mac/x-help-action:/openApp?bundleId=com.apple.ScriptEditor2)\n\n* In the Script Editor app ![](https://help.apple.com/assets/67DB7E842551EA97CB00BED5/67DB7E8502C5F38AAF0D7DC6/en_US/2d1774dafc25e40f6f806216d54cdf01.png) on your Mac, [Control-click](https://support.apple.com/guide/script-editor/aside/glosb9214f98/2.11/mac/26) the script window, then choose a routine from the pop-up menu.\n\n  The routine is inserted at the cursor location in the script. If text is selected in the script, the routine is wrapped around the selected text.\n\nHere are some of the routines you can insert into your script.\n\n| Routine | | | | Description | | | | | | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Error handlers | | | | Error routines provide information related to any errors encountered when you run the script. | | | | | | | |\n| Image manipulation | | | | Image manipulation routines do graphics processing of image files. | | | | | | | |\n| Tell blocks | | | | “Tell” blocks direct a series of commands to a particular app or component. | | | | | | | |\n| Conditionals | | | | Conditional statements run a series of commands if the correct conditions exist. | | | | | | | |\n| Iterate items | | | | Iteration routines process multiple files. | | | | | | | |\n| Repeat routines | | | | Repeat routines cause a series of commands to repeat until a condition changes. | | | | | | | |\n| String comparison | | | | Lets you consider or ignore specific types of characters when comparing strings. | | | | | | | |\n| Action clauses | | | | Action clauses apply special conditions to the execution of a group of statements. | | | | | | | |\n| Folder action handlers | | | | Folder actions occur when a change happens to a folder. Use the folder action to automatically run a script. | | | | | | | |\n| Dialogs | | | | Dialog routines let you ask the user questions when you run the script. | | | | | | | |\n\n**See also**[Access scripts using the Script menu in Script Editor on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/script-editor/access-scripts-using-the-script-menu-scpedt27975/2.11/mac/26)\n",
