View an app’s scripting dictionary in Script Editor on Mac

An app’s scripting dictionary displays the scripting vocabulary understood by an app or a scripting addition.

To find out what commands and objects you can use to control an app, use Script Editor to look at that app’s dictionary. The scripting dictionary of an app is organized into different suites. Most scriptable apps contain at least the standard suite. Other apps may have a variety of different suites of objects and commands available. An app’s dictionary may contain multiple languages—for example an app’s dictionary may include both AppleScript and JavaScript for Automation.
