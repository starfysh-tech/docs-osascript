About Script Editor on Mac

Script Editor lets you create powerful scripts, tools, and even apps. You can create scripts to perform repetitive tasks, automate complex workflows, and control apps or even the system. You can use various scripting languages, including AppleScript, JavaScript for Automation, shell scripts, and also some third-party scripting languages.

In Script Editor, you can edit, debug, and compile your scripts. When your script is finished, you can save it as an app or a droplet.
