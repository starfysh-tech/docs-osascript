Access scripts using the Script menu in Script Editor on Mac

You can show the Script menu
 in the menu bar to make it easy to access your scripts.

The Script menu already contains many useful scripts, but you can also add your own. The Script menu supports applets, droplets, and uncompiled scripts, as well as aliases, even to remote computers.

Open Script Editor for me

Show the Script menu in the menu bar

In the Script Editor app
 on your Mac, choose Script Editor > Settings, then click General.

Select the “Show Script menu in menu bar” checkbox, then make sure the “Show Computer scripts” checkbox is selected.

The Script menu
 appears on the right side of the menu bar.

The next time you need to access a script, just click the Script menu icon in the menu bar, then choose an option.

Add a script to the Script menu

In the Script Editor app
 on your Mac, save your script as a file in the Finder, then copy the file into the Script Editor Scripts folder (located in the Scripts folder in the Library folder on your startup disk).
