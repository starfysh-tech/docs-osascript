Run a script in Script Editor on Mac

When you run a script, Script Editor checks the script for errors, compiles it, then executes each of the commands. The script remains editable, so you can quickly make changes and run it again. This makes it very convenient to view the results of changes you make in your script.

Open Script Editor for me

In the Script Editor app
 on your Mac, click the Run button
 in the toolbar, or press Command-R, to execute the commands in your script.

To view a log of the actions and results in a script, choose Window > Log History before running the script.
