Open Script Editor for me

In the Script Editor app
 on your Mac, choose Script Editor > Settings.

Click History.

Select or deselect Enable Log History to turn the event logs on or off.

To log all entries, select Unlimited Entries, or to set a limit, select Maximum Entries, then enter the maximum number.

Select “Log only when visible” to turn off events so they are logged only when the lower pane of the Script Editor window is visible, or when the Log History window is open.
