Change Script Editor settings on Mac

Script Editor uses fonts and colors in the text to indicate different language components and hierarchy.

Use the Formatting pane of Script Editor settings to change the font, color, and typeface of scripts in Script Editor and in the Xcode development environment.

Open Script Editor for me

In the Script Editor app
 on your Mac, choose Script Editor > Settings, then click Formatting.

Click the Language pop-up menu, then choose a scripting language.

To change the font of a category item, double-click the font name in the Font column, then select the collection, typeface, style, and size in the Fonts window.

To change the color of a font category item, double-click a color swatch in the Color column, then select the color you want.

Click Apply.

If scripts are open in Script Editor when you change the settings, the new formatting appears after the scripts are recompiled.
