Set line wrapping in Script Editor on Mac

Automatic line wrapping lets you write script statements of any length that wrap to fit the size of the script window.

Open Script Editor for me

In the Script Editor app
 on your Mac, choose Script Editor > Settings, then click Editing.

To enable automatic line wrapping, select “Wrap lines to editor width.”

To indent the wrapped line, select “Indent wrapped lines by,” then enter the number of spaces to indent.
