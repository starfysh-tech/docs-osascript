Prompting for a Choice from a List

Use the Standard Additions scripting additionâ€™s
choose from list

Listing 28-2
JavaScript: Prompting the user to choose from a list of items

var app = Application.currentApplication()

app.includeStandardAdditions = true

var fruitChoices = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]

var favoriteFruit = app.chooseFromList(fruitChoices, {

withPrompt: "Select your favorite fruit:",

defaultItems: ["Apple"]

})

favoriteFruit

// Result: ["Apple"]

The
choose from list
 command can optionally let the user choose multiple items by setting the
multiple selections allowed
 parameter to
true
. For this reason, the result of the command is always a list of selected strings. This list may be empty if the
empty selection allowed
 parameter has been specified and the user dismissed the dialog without making a selection.
