Running a Script

Scripts can be opened and run in Script Editor and script applications can be run outside of Script Editor like any other OS X application. Some apps and tools, such as Automator and the systemwide script menu, can also run scripts.

Running a Script in Script Editor

To run a script in Script Editor, click the Run button (
) in the toolbar, press Command-R, or choose Script > Run, as shown in Figure 8-1.

Running a script in Script Editor

As the script runs, the Accessory View pane shows events and results of the script. This information can be useful for troubleshooting. See
Viewing Script Events and Results
.

Running a Script Application

To run a script application, double-click the script in the Finder, just like you would do to launch any other application. The script opens and begins running.

Note

When running a script app outside of Script Editor, you can’t view a list of the script’s events and results. To monitor this activity, open the app in Script Editor instead, run it, and check the Accessory View pane.
