Types of Scripts

There are many different types of scripts on the Mac.

Applets
—A script that’s been saved as an app. It behaves like other apps. Double-click it to launch and run it. When an applet is launched, any code in its
run
 handler executes. If a script doesn’t contain an explicit
run
 handler, then the top level of the script is treated as an implicit
run
 handler and any code there executes.

Droplets
—A script applet that has been configured to accept dropped files and folders. Double-click it to launch and run it—execute its
run
 handler. Or, drag and drop files and folders onto it to process them. In a droplet, dropped files and folders are passed directly to an AppleScript
open
 handler or JavaScript
openDocuments
 function for processing.

Scripts
—A script document file. Double-click it to open it for editing. Some apps and processes can load and run scripts. For example, Mail rules can execute scripts to process messages matching specific criteria. Scripts are sometimes referred to as
compiled scripts
.

Script bundles
—A script document that’s been saved in
bundle
 format. A bundle is a directory with a standardized, hierarchical structure that holds executable code and the resources used by that code.

Stay-open scripts
—By default, applets and droplets run and quit after launch. When configured as stay-open, however, they remain open until explicitly ordered to quit. Often, stay-open scripts include an
idle
 handler, which initiates periodic actions.
